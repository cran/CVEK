Description: 
  Implementation of Cross-Validated Kernel Ensemble (CVEK), 
  a flexible modeling framework for robust nonlinear regression and 
  hypothesis testing based on ensemble learning with kernel-ridge estimators 
  (Jeremiah et al. (2017) <arXiv:1710.01406> and 
  Wenying et al. (2018) <arXiv:1811.11025>). It allows user to conduct 
  nonlinear regression with minimal assumption on the function form by 
  aggregating nonlinear models generated from a diverse collection of kernel 
  families. It also provides utilities to test for the estimated nonlinear 
  effect under this ensemble estimator, using either the asymptotic or 
  the bootstrap version of a generalized score test.
